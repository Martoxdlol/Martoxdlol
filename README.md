Hi, my name is Tomás.

I am a computer engineering student at UBA (University of Buenos Aires). I have been dedicating my time to learn and develop software on different platforms and programming languages. I have extensive knowledge in technology, and I enjoy learning and understanding how things work.

I am also an electromechanical technician.

My primary language of expertise is JavaScript/TypeScript, but I also have experience in programming with Python, C, Dart and SmallTalk (yes, really). (I can program in other languages, but I do not have as much experience).

My favourite web stack is t3 (https://create.t3.gg/)

My favourite language is **dart**

I study computer engineering at the University of Buenos Aires.
